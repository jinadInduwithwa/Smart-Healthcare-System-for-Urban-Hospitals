```powershell
# Watch server logs in Terminal 1
# Look for:
‚úì "Payment created"
‚úì "Stripe checkout session created"
‚úì "Stripe webhook received"
‚úì "Payment verified"
```

### Stripe Dashboard

https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

- View all test payments
- See webhook events
- Check event details

### Database

```javascript
// MongoDB Compass or CLI
// Check collections:
-payments - appointments;
```

---

## Performance Testing

### Load Test (Optional)

```powershell
# Create multiple payments
for ($i=1; $i -le 10; $i++) {
    echo "Creating payment $i"
    # Run create payment API call
}
```

---

## Security Testing

### Test Authentication
