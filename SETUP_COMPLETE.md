## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Administrator
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe
stripe login
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Dasun\Desktop\my_d\Yesr 3 project\Smart-Healthcare-System-for-Urban-Hospitals"
.\setup-stripe.ps1
```

This will:

- Check your setup
- Open 2 terminals automatically
- Start your server
- Start Stripe webhook listener

### Step 3: Add Webhook Secret

1. Look at Terminal 2 (Stripe listener)
2. Copy the webhook secret: `whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. Open `.env` file
4. Update: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. Restart server (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1, then `pnpm run dev:backend`)

**Done! Your payment system is ready! 🎉**

stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### Test Cards

| Card Number           | Result       |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Success   |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | ❌ Declined  |
| `4000 0027 6000 3184` | 🔒 3D Secure |

### Test with Frontend

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/patient/payments`
2. Select payment
3. Click "Proceed with Card Payment"
4. Use test card above
5. Complete payment
6. Verify status updates to "PAID"

## 🔄 Payment Flow

```
1. Patient books appointment
   → Payment record created (status: PENDING)

2. Patient clicks "Pay Now"
   → Stripe Checkout session created
   → Redirected to Stripe

3. Patient enters card details
   → Payment processed by Stripe

4. Payment succeeds
   → Stripe sends webhook to your server
   → Server updates payment status to PAID
   → Appointment confirmed

5. Patient redirected back
   → Sees success message
   → Can view receipt
```
